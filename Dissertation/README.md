The Main Text

The Examiners will be looking for quality rather than quantity in your dissertation. You should try to keep the main text of your dissertation as concise as possible. Spelling should be correct, sentences grammatical, and formulae, figures and tables accurate. All figures, tables and appendices should be given numbers and headings. Your writing should be precise, concise and fluent. Avoid the first person (i.e. say what was done, rather than that you did it). Some dissertations may be organised differently from that headings given below. In particular, some parts might have more emphasis than others for some projects Further advice will be available from your supervisor. Below is a sample of what might be expected.
#
1.0 Introduction and Problem Specification

Background material should be given which introduces the problem area, its context and background. You should identify the particular problem under consideration along with information about the problem area that enables the reader to understand the problem scope and nature. If your project involves a particular domain, algorithm, method theory etc., you may describe it in the introduction (alternatively or additionally, it may be described later, if appropriate). For best marks the student should show that they have systematically researched and fully analysed the problem, synthesising the relevant information.

2.0 System Requirements Specification

You should provide a precise description of the system developed. These may have been written much earlier but for the dissertation they should be updated to match the final system delivered. You should list any assumptions made about the problem and any system constraints. Overall your requirements, functional AND non-functional should be complete, clear, accurate, feasible and objectively verifiable. Content depends on your project but could include:

* A complete set of function definitions (as use cases if preferred), as far as possible written so as to be testable

* Measurable and testable non-functional requirements

* Description of interfaces required such as with other software or systems

* Any specific user interface requirement

* User characteristics

The target to aim for here is that your requirements could be the basis for a contract or handing to external developers to complete.

3. Design

This section should describe the design of your proposed system. Normally this several parts, depending on your project:

(i) Architectural Description of the system â€“ textual and/or diagrammatic. This could be a simple diagram showing the components and how they relate or it could describe the choice of architectural style or pattern used.

(ii) User Interface Design (if applicable). Show sketches of the design or screenshots with explanations of choices made, if necessary.

(iii) Software System Design.

The role of each component and the interfaces between components should be described. There should be a clear correlation between your design and your specification.

The design should be linked to requirements and, where applicable give a critical discussion of key design decisions/styles/patterns used. There might be a data model, a UI design, details of external interfaces, and of other important issues e.g. concurrency, event handling, error and exception handling, security, data persistence. No particular notation or tool is mandated.

4. Implementation and Testing

You should describe any languages, packages, and libraries etc. that are used in the development of your system. There is no need to describe your code in detail. You may highlight data types and implementation techniques that are of special interest. If appropriate, you may provide:

(a) Choice of implementation language(s)/ development environment(s)

(b) Use of software libraries;

(c) Key implementation decisions

(d) A description of how some important functions and algorithms were implemented.

(e) A description of how each component is implemented.

(f) Discussion of Test Approach e.g. unit testing, system testing, regression testing etc; Test cases described; Testing tools used. Evidence that testing coverage was complete.

Program code can be accessed by the assessors via the git repository so there is no need to print code listings. It is recommended that you comment code appropriately. Programs should be written in a clear style with good program structure and well-defined data structures. The program code should reflect its design.

5. System Evaluation and Experimental Results

Different projects will have a different emphasis. In all cases you are expected to provide empirical results and to draw conclusions from those results. You may use your software to generate experimental results. Be sure to describe the methodology of your evaluation or experimentation. An experiment is typically described in terms of its goals, the hypotheses being tested, the subject of the experiment, what is being

measured and what is controlled, the results obtained and the analysis and interpretation of those results. Alternatively, you can assess the product in terms of how it compares with other similar products and/or in terms of user feedback (e.g. via a survey) or some measurable quality aspect such performance efficiency or reliability. Your supervisor can guide you on what is appropriate, but typically the very best projects have shown results that could be publishable with little or no work or show an exemplary empirically based evaluation of a software product

6. Conclusion

A general summary evaluation of the success of the project should be given with respect to criteria identified in the introduction. A discussion of the significance of your experimental results may be appropriate. Do they agree with other previous work or ideas? How does your system compare with similar ones? An evaluation of the hardware/software environment and language used may be presented, if appropriate. Draw conclusions on the process used in the project as well. What went well? What did not go well? What are the strengths of your solution or conclusions? What are the weaknesses? Suggestions for further work should also be discussed. You can be critical and draw a negative conclusion. Not all projects will be successful. A well-explained failure is as an acceptable an outcome as a spectacular success. Assessors are looking for excellence in a critical appraisal of the work and a convincing argument for the significance of contribution in the context of wider work.
